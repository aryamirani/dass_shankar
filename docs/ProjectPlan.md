# Project Plan

Use this document to outline milestones, risks, and weekly goals.

## Team
- Name: 
- Role: 

## Weekly Goals
- Week 1 [Jan 16-17]: Finalize requirements for the project.
- Week 2 [Fan 18-24]: Become familiar with the codebase and existing modules.
- Week 3 [Jan 25-31]: Divide the work of creating new modules between team members and discuss the implementation plan.
- Week 4 [Feb 1-7]: Complete modules for all the exercises in Grade 1 Workbook a and send to client for progress monitoring.
- Week 5 [Feb 8-14]: Make necessary UI changes to make the website user-friendly and intuitive. Request client for Workbook e and divide the implementation between team members.

## Milestones
- Week 1: Finalized requirements for the project with the client.
- Week 2: Made UI changes requested by client from the first meeting.
- Week 3: Discussed method of implementing new modules so that different types of exercises are created and consistency is maintained across the website.
- Week 4: Visited Shankar Foundation and understood the teaching methodology, which gave a better idea of types of questions to include.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: (Faced during week 3) Lack of UI uniformity across all modules if each team member is implementing exercises in each section independently
- Mitigation: Divide implementation between team members such that each feature implemented by each team member is done across all the modules for consistency.
